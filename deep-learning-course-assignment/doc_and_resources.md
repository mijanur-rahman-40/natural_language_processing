##### Abstractive Text Summarization
``` Abstractive Text Summarization is the task of generating a short and concise summary that captures the salient ideas of the source text. The generated summaries potentially contain new phrases and sentences that may not appear in the source text.```

#### BERT ALGORITHM

```
BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is based on Transformers, a deep learning model in which every output element is connected to every input element, and the weightings between them are dynamically calculated based upon their connection.
