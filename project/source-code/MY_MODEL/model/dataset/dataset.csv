1.1,What is the role of a prototype program in problem solving?,To simulate the behaviour of portions of the desired software product.,High risk problems are address in the prototype program to make sure that the program is feasible.  A prototype may also be used to show a company that the software can be possibly programmed.,4,3,3.5
1.1,What is the role of a prototype program in problem solving?,To simulate the behaviour of portions of the desired software product.,To simulate portions of the desired final product with a quick and easy program that does a small specific job. It is a way to help see what the problem is and how you may solve it in the final project.,5,5,5
1.1,What is the role of a prototype program in problem solving?,To simulate the behaviour of portions of the desired software product.,A prototype program simulates the behaviors of portions of the desired software product to allow for error checking.,5,3,4
1.1,What is the role of a prototype program in problem solving?,To simulate the behaviour of portions of the desired software product.,"Defined in the Specification phase a prototype stimulates the behavior of portions of the desired software product.  Meaning, the role of a prototype is a temporary solution until the program itself is refined to be used extensively in problem solving.",5,5,5
1.1,What is the role of a prototype program in problem solving?,To simulate the behaviour of portions of the desired software product.,It is used to let the users have a first idea of the completed program and allow the clients to evaluate the program. This can generate much feedback including software specifications and project estimations of the total project.,3,3,3
1.1,What is the role of a prototype program in problem solving?,To simulate the behaviour of portions of the desired software product.,To find problem and errors in a program before it is finalized,2,2,2
1.1,What is the role of a prototype program in problem solving?,To simulate the behaviour of portions of the desired software product.,"To address major issues in the creation of the program. There is no way to account for all possible bugs in the program, but it is possible to prove the program is tangible. ",3,2,2.5
1.1,What is the role of a prototype program in problem solving?,To simulate the behaviour of portions of the desired software product.,you can break the whole program into prototype programs to simulate parts of the final program,5,5,5
1.1,What is the role of a prototype program in problem solving?,To simulate the behaviour of portions of the desired software product.,#NAME?,5,2,3.5
1.1,What is the role of a prototype program in problem solving?,To simulate the behaviour of portions of the desired software product.,Simulating the behavior of only a portion of the desired software product.,5,5,5
1.1,What is the role of a prototype program in problem solving?,To simulate the behaviour of portions of the desired software product.,A program that stimulates the behavior of portions of the desired software product.,5,5,5
