    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Jaccard similarity is good for cases where duplication does not matter, cosine similarity is good for cases where duplication matters while analyzing text similarity. For two product descriptions, it will be better to use Jaccard similarity as repetition of a word does not reduce their similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Alternatives like cosine or Euclidean distance can also be used, but the authors state that: “Manhattan distance slightly outperforms other reasonable alternatives such as cosine similarity”.\n"
